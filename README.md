- OOP Concepts 🧱  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Smart-Bus-Ticket-Booking-System.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:

## 🧾 How to Use  
1. 🆕 **Add Buses**: The system allows you to add new buses by specifying: Bus ID, Source, Destination, Departure time, and Total number of seats.  
2. 🔍 **Find Buses**: Search for buses between a source and destination.  
3. 🎟️ **Book a Ticket**: Provide the Bus ID and passenger name to book a ticket. The system automatically assigns the next available seat. If no seats are available, it shows a message: `No seats available 😞`  
4. 📊 **Output**: Ticket confirmation messages are printed in the console with seat numbers.  

## 🧪 Sample Output  
```bash  
Ticket Booked 🎟️ | Bus ID: BUS1001 | Seat: 1 | Passenger: Alice  
Ticket Booked 🎟️ | Bus ID: BUS1001 | Seat: 2 | Passenger: Bob  
Ticket Booked 🎟️ | Bus ID: BUS1001 | Seat: 3 | Passenger: Charlie  
No seats available 😞  
```
